# Hospital-Administration

Overview
The online platform that are being used in the hospitals are extensive with the multitude of informations related to patients, doctors, their visits, various procedures etc. It is extremely complex to develop such an exhaustive platform which will be used by so many users across locations/regions and that has connections to various other platforms, databases etc. Addition of all these details pertaining to the hospital in an administrative point of view starts only with the patient's need to see the doctor. This process needs to be streamlined so that the subsequent processes are able to run smoothly. Hence we are working on this project that mainly focuses on the initial phase of any hospital administration process which includes adding new patients, new doctors, booking appointments etc. It is extremely important to have a full medical history documented properly for all the patients right from the beginning even before the patient makes his/her first appointment.

The project we are planning to create is a hospital administration app wherein we will use it for creating new patients, new doctor getting associated with that hospital, booking an appointment for new as well as existing patients, editing an appointment, deleting an appointment,viewing all the details, selecting a particular detail with a specific search condition etc. This app can be viewed as a one stop place for handling and viewing all the appointments.
